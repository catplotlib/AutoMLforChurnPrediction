# AutoML for Churn Prediction
This repository contains the AutoML for Churn Prediction project. It utilizes Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) techniques to predict customer churn in a telecom company. Customer churn refers to the situation when a customer ceases their relationship with a company. Accurate prediction of churn can help businesses to develop effective customer retention strategies and minimize loss.

# Project Overview
Churn prediction is a common use case for Machine Learning in the telecom industry, and this project showcases how to automate the process using AutoML. The dataset we used comes from a telecom company and includes customer demographic and usage information. Using this data, the model predicts whether a customer is likely to stop using the company's services.
